# 42cursus-cpp-piscine
The 12th project of 42 curriculum is a C++ piscine which aims to introduce students to Object-Oriented Programming. C++ was chosen because it's derived our old and familiar C Language. Because that one is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, the code will comply with the C++98 standard.
